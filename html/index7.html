<h2><a name=""><font color="blue">The Privacy Rule</font></a></h2>

<p>
The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individualsâ€™ medical records and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically.  The Rule requires appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of personal health information, and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such information without patient authorization. The Rule also gives patients rights over their health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records, and to request corrections.
</p>
<p>
The Privacy Rule is located at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164.</p>

<p>
The Civil Rights Division (CRD) in the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) promotes and ensures that people have equal access to and opportunity to participate in certain health care and human services programs without facing unlawful discrimination. CRD carries out this mission by enforcing Federal laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination, including health care provider conscience rights, on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in certain circumstances, sex and religion, in programs and activities that receive financial assistance from HHS.  CRD also enforces a Federal law and regulation that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in health care and social service programs of state and local governments.

<h2><a name="File"></a><font color="blue">How to File a Complaint</font></h2>
<p>
If you feel a health care provider, or state or local government agency, has discriminated against you (or someone else) based on race, national origin, disability, or age, you may file a civil rights complaint. OCR can also investigate disability-based discrimination complaints against programs operated by HHS. Under certain statutes and regulations, OCR also has limited authority to investigate complaints of discrimination based on sex and religion. If you believe your health care provider conscience protection rights have been violated, you may file a complaint with OCR.

The Case Resolution Manual for Civil Rights Investigations (CRM) provides OCR staff and managers with the procedures and strategies designed to promptly and effectively evaluate, investigate, and resolve complaints and compliance reviews, and to enforce violation findings where warranted.

We recommend that you use the Civil Rights Discrimination Complaint Form Package to submit a written complaint. You can also request a copy of this form from an OCR regional office. If you need help filing a complaint or have a question about the complaint or consent forms, please email OCR at OCRComplaint@hhs.gov.
</p>
<p>
<strong>THE CIVIL RIGHTS NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROHIBITRETALIATION</strong> - Under Civil Rights Laws an entity cannot retaliate against you for filing a complaint. You should notify OCR immediately in the event of any retaliatory action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR COMPLAINT TOOCR</strong> - To submit a complaint to OCR, please use one of the following methods.
<ul>
	<li>File A Complaint Electronically Using OCR Complaint Portal</li>
	<li>File A Complaint Using Our Civil Rights Discrimination Complaint Form Package</li>
	<li>File A Complaint Without Using Our Civil Rights Discrimination Complaint Form Package</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you mail or fax the complaint, be sure to send it to the appropriate OCR regional office based on where the alleged violation took place. OCR has ten regional offices, and each regional office covers specific states. Send your complaint to the attention of the OCR Regional Manager. You do not need to sign the complaint and consent forms when you submit them by email because submission by email represents your signature.
